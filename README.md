## Paige's Art from Code: Structured Generative Art

## **General Information**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: This is my completed work for the Art from Code assignment where I chose the structured generative art option. Note that the code used in this project originated from Danielle Navarro's "Art From Code" exercises and materials.

Collaborators: Paige Lund

Research Focus: Exploring new forms of data visualization and understanding mechanisms for creating artwork within R code. Assignment demonstrates an understanding of introductory of artistic data visualization methods, use of spatial noise tricks, and exploration of iterated function systems.
